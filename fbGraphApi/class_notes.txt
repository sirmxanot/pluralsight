Understanding Graph API
- API: Application Programming Interface
- an API is an interface to the host operating system
- the web has host systems too, one of which is facebook
- web APIs give access to web host systems
- web API: "A server-side web API is a programmatic interface to a defined request-response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML, which is exposed via the web--most commonly by means of an HTTP-based web server." -Wikipedia
- web API == web service == platform
- graph API is facebook's request/response model for accessing all FB data
- objects: people, pages, events, photos, create your own, + many more
- open graph protocol can make anything on the web an object
- GET https://graph.facebook.com/ojbect_id will return that object's attributes in JSON
- many objects require a token to be passed in the url GET https://graph.facebook.com/ojbect_id?oauth_token=token
- connections are a relationship between objects
- connections: friends, likes, comments, interests, etc
- append the connection type to the object get request: GET https://graph.facebook.com/ojbect_id/connection_type?oauth_token=token
- GET https://graph.facebook.com/ojbect_id?metadata=1 will show you all the information that you can access for this object including connections
- graph API is a RESTS CRUD API. it supports:
      create    POST
      read      GET
      update    PUT
      delete    DELETE


Testing Your App
- graph api explorer is an online tool to see what calls will return in the API
- https://developers.facebook.com
- JavaScript Test Console is a fb tool to help with JS dev
- FB App Dashboard
- FB Insights Dashboard
- you need to create test users because FB doesn't allow fake user accounts
- search Test Users on developers.facebook.com
- Access Token Tool
- Access Token Debugger
- Open Graph Debugger


Understanding Facebook Auth

- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/
